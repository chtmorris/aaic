                We combine our work with our portfolio companies with serious capital commitments, often participate in follow-on rounds and help in all aspects of further capital raising efforts.

              <h3>Investment Philosophy
              </h3>
              <p class="AAICinfo">
                AAIC Ventures brings a professional and active approach to investing in early stage companies similar to VC funds but, as we invest our own capital, we don’t have a defined time horizon or undisclosed agendas from Limited Partners.
                We don’t see ourselves as capital allocators and so don’t spread our capital among a large number of companies but prefer to have meaningful stakes that warrant our active involvement.
                We are therefore usually on the boards of our portfolio companies and look at stakes larger than 5% after series B.
                We often lead seed stage or smaller series A rounds and participate in follow on funding rounds.
                Supporting our existing portfolio companies always takes priority and the lion share of our time.
                We enjoy being directly involved in helping build businesses and think of ourselves as investor-preneures and partners of the founders.
